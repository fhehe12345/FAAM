# Project Concept Statement
## Problem Statement
Access to timely and reliable medical information can be challenging, especially in areas with limited healthcare services. Many individuals search online for symptoms, which can lead to misinformation and unnecessary anxiety. This project aims to develop an AI-powered chatbot that provides accurate, easy-to-understand medical guidance, helping users make informed decisions and know when to seek professional care.

## Objectives
•	Provide 24/7 instant responses to common health inquiries.
•	Deliver personalized symptom checking and health guidance.
•	Assist users in identifying whether professional medical attention is needed.
•	Improve accessibility to basic healthcare information.


## Proposed Approach
Use Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Large Language Models (LLMs) to understand and respond to user queries. Incorporate a medical knowledge base and symptom-checking algorithms to provide reliable suggestions. The chatbot will be accessible via web and mobile platforms with a user-friendly interface.

## Expected Outcome
An intelligent chatbot capable of delivering accurate, personalized medical guidance with over 85% response accuracy, reducing unnecessary clinic visits and empowering users with health awareness.

## Evaluation Metrics
•	Response accuracy (Precision, Recall, F1-Score)
•	User satisfaction rating (through feedback surveys)
•	Average response time
•	Number of resolved queries without escalation to a doctor
