### Which phase of your project had the most subtasks?
The planning phase had many subtasks, including defining objectives, roles, and tools.

### How did breaking tasks down help you plan better?
It gave a better overview of the project and made the timeline more realistic.

### What would you adjust in your project schedule next week?
I’ll update the Gantt chart to match the actual progress and new task estimates.
