### Questions:
1. Which project phase has the highest cost and why?  
2. How could you reduce costs without affecting quality?  
3. How does resource allocation influence your schedule and overall success?  

### Answers:
1. **Highest cost phase:** Model Development & Evaluation has the highest cost because it involves intensive tasks like training and optimizing the model, which require more hours and specialized resources.  
2. **Cost reduction:** Use open-source software tools instead of paid licenses and run training on local machines where possible.  
3. **Resource allocation impact:** Efficient allocation ensures tasks are completed on time; overloading one resource could delay the schedule and affect project quality.
